{-| If a screenreader reads some content, and then that content changes, the user may not be aware that anything happened. This is where live regions come in. Live regions (and associated properties) can tell the screenreader what relevant changing information to present to the user, and how urgently the information is needed.

-}

import Accessibility.Utils exposing (..)
import Html


{-| Supported for all elements.

This property indicates that a region is live, and may change even when the region doesn't have focus. When `True`, all the contents of the element will be presented to the user.

-}
atomic : Bool -> Html.Attribute msg
atomic =
    aria "atomic" << toBoolString


{-| Supported for all elements.

When set to `True`, this is the aria equivalent of a loading spinner--indicates that stuff is changing/is not ready for interaction/reading-off yet.

-}
busy : Bool -> Html.Attribute msg
busy =
    aria "busy" << toBoolString


{-| Supported by all elements.

When the region's contents change, assistive technologies will wait for a good moment to interrupt and do so politely with the update.

-}
polite : Html.Attribute msg
polite =
    aria "live" "polite"


{-| Identical to `polite`. Included for backwards-compatibility. A future version of the library will likely remove this helper.
-}
livePolite : Html.Attribute msg
livePolite =
    polite


{-| Supported by all elements.

Updates to the region will cause the assistive technologies to immediately interrupt the user with the big news.

-}
assertive : Html.Attribute msg
assertive =
    aria "live" "assertive"


{-| Identical to `assertive`. Included for backwards-compatibility. A future version of the library will likely remove this helper.
